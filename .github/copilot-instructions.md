# Copilot Instructions for Toka2RepoSMu

## Project Overview
This repository contains documentation and personal/professional background information for Satu Musakka, focused on healthcare technology, digitalization, and professional experience. The main content is in markdown files, with no code or build/test workflows present.

## Key Files
- `viikko1.md`: Main profile and experience documentation. Contains structured sections about professional history, technical interests, and online presence.
- `README.md`: Currently empty, but typically used for project-level documentation.

## Patterns and Conventions
- All content is written in Finnish, with some English technical terms.
- Markdown formatting is used for headings, lists, links, and emphasis.
- Profile sections are clearly separated with headings (e.g., `## Kiinnostus ja osaaminen`, `## Profiilini verkossa`).
- Links use standard markdown syntax.
- No code, scripts, or automation are present in the repository.

## AI Agent Guidance
- Focus on maintaining clear, well-structured markdown documentation.
- When updating or adding content, preserve the existing section structure and formatting conventions.
- If adding new sections, use Finnish headings and follow the style of `viikko1.md`.
- Do not introduce code, build scripts, or automation unless explicitly requested.
- If README.md is updated, ensure it provides a clear summary of the repository's purpose and main files.
